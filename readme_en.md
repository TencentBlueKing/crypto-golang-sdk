# BlueKing crypto-golang-sdk

---

## Overview

Ô∏èüîß BlueKing crypto-golang-sdk is a lightweight cryptography toolkit based on encryption libraries such as tongsuo, 
providing a unified encryption and decryption implementation for Golang applications, making it easy for
projects to switch between different encryption methods without intrusion.

## Features

* [Basic] Supports Chinese commercial cryptography algorithms: SM4
* [Basic] Supports mainstream international cryptography algorithms: AES

## Getting started

### Installation

#### tongsuo compilation and installation

1. Download the tongsuo installation package, version 8.3.2 is recommended
   https://github.com/Tongsuo-Project/Tongsuo/releases

2. tongsuo library compilation and installation
   At present, the operating systems supported by tongsuo are: various Linux distributions, macOS, Android, iOS and Windows. On these operating systems, the corresponding environment needs to be prepared in advance:
    - make
    - Perl 5, and the Text::Template module
    - C compiler
    - C library
      Tongsuo has little dependence on third-party libraries, but it still relies heavily on Perl.

Let's take the linux environment as an example, assuming that the tongsuo installation path is: `/opt/tongsuo`:

``` bash
# --prefix option can customize the installation directory, if not set, the default is /usr/local/
./config --prefix=/opt/tongsuo
# compile
make -j
# Install
make install
```

For detailed compilation and installation process, please refer to:

#### Reference crypto-golang-sdk in the code

```golang
import "github.com/TencentBlueKing/crypto-golang-sdk"
```

#### Compile code that references crypto-golang-sdk

1. Install the pkg-config tool
2. Set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the pkg-config path of the tongsuo library compiled in the first step (usually the lib/pkgconfig directory under the installation path), and compile

Let's take the Linux environment as an example, assuming that the installation path of tongsuo is: `/opt/tongsuo`, and the path of pkg-config is: `/opt/tongsuo/lib/pkgconfig`:

``` bash
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/tongsuo/lib/pkgconfig CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o main .
```

### Usage

Let's take SM4 encryption and decryption as an example:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/TencentBlueKing/crypto-golang-sdk"
)

func main() {
	// ÂéüÊñá
	plaintext := []byte("origin text")

	// ÈÖçÁΩÆÁöÑkey
	key := []byte("key\\0")

	// ÂàõÂª∫Âä†Ëß£ÂØÜÂô®
	crypto, err := bkcrypto.NewSm4(key)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("new crypto failed, err: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Âä†ÂØÜÊìç‰Ωú
	ciphertext, err := crypto.Encrypt(plaintext)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("encrypt failed, err: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	// Ëß£ÂØÜÊìç‰Ωú
	decrypted, err := crypto.Decrypt(ciphertext)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("decrypt failed, err: %v\n", err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("encrypted text: %s, decrypted text: %s\n", ciphertext, decrypted)
}
```
